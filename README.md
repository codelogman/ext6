# Android Binary Stream File System App

## Project Description
This Android application implements a proprietary file system designed for secure file management. It leverages binary streams to store files, which are both encrypted and compressed, within a custom file structure. Instead of traditional SQL, this app utilizes file operation commands akin to those found in a Linux environment, such as `fileopen`, `mkdir`, `dir`, `cp file`, etc.

## Features
- **Linux-Style File Commands**: Manage your files using familiar Linux commands.
- **Encryption & Compression**: Enhances security and efficiency by encrypting and compressing files.
- **Custom File System**: Utilizes a unique file system based on binary streams for robust data handling.
